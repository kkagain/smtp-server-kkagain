# 🔧 Quick Setup Guide - Restore Functionality After Security Fix

## ⚠️ URGENT: Replace Exposed Credentials

Your SMTP credentials were exposed and GitGuardian detected them. Follow these steps to restore functionality:

### Step 1: Generate New Gmail App Password

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**: [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. **Delete the old app password** for this application
3. **Generate a new 16-character app password**
4. **Copy the new password** (format: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

### Step 2: Update Your Local Configuration

**Edit your `.env` file** and replace the SMTP_PASS value:

```bash
# Replace this line in your .env file:
SMTP_PASS=REPLACE_WITH_NEW_APP_PASSWORD_IMMEDIATELY

# With your new app password (remove spaces):
SMTP_PASS=abcdEFGHijklMNOP
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Test your server after updating credentials:

```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev

# Test email functionality (in another terminal)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/send-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "your-test-email@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email After Security Fix",
    "html": "<h1>✅ Security Fix Applied</h1><p>Your SMTP server is working with new secure credentials!</p>"
  }'
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed exposed files from Git**:
   - `gmail-config.json` (contained password: `qtqd bcqk qzgg iwjc`)
   - `real-test-email.json`
   - Other test files with sensitive data

2. **Enhanced .gitignore**:
   - Added patterns to prevent future credential exposure
   - Covers all config files with credentials

3. **Code still works**: Your application uses environment variables (`process.env.SMTP_*`), so functionality is preserved

## 🛡️ Security Measures Applied

- ✅ Sensitive files removed from Git tracking
- ✅ Enhanced .gitignore patterns
- ✅ Created secure configuration templates
- ✅ Added comprehensive security documentation
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

## 🔍 Files That Are Now Secure

| File | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `gmail-config.json` | ❌ Removed | Use `.env` instead |
| `real-test-email.json` | ❌ Removed | Use API testing |
| `.env` | ✅ Secure | Update with new credentials |
| `.env.example` | ✅ Template | Safe for Git |
| `gmail-config.example.json` | ✅ Template | Safe for Git |

## 🚀 Your Application Features Still Work

All your SMTP MCP Server features remain functional:

- ✅ Send single emails
- ✅ Send bulk emails  
- ✅ SMTP configuration management
- ✅ Email templates
- ✅ Email logging and tracking
- ✅ Swagger documentation
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Database integration
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Langchain integration ready

## 📝 Testing Checklist

After updating your credentials:

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Can send test email
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Swagger documentation accessible
- [ ] No credential warnings in logs

## 🆘 If You Need Help

If anything doesn't work:
1. Check the `.env` file has the correct new app password
2. Verify the Gmail app password is active
3. Check server logs for specific error messages
4. Ensure no spaces in the app password

## 🔒 Future Security

- Always use `.env` files for credentials (they're gitignored)
- Never commit config files with real passwords
- Rotate credentials every 90 days
- Monitor for security alerts
- Use different credentials for dev/production

Your application is now secure and ready to use! 🎉
